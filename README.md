The script provide all the relevant functions to install required applications and setup the environment for a development machine.
User can call specific functions to install on a per-application basis or can use the automation process to do everything.

In short:
- Create the permanent directory structure
- Setup the PowerShell user profile
- Setup the PowerShell module development environment: builder and environment values
- Install my personalized PowerShell modules
- Install 3rd party PowerShell modules
- Install Git for Windows
- Install SublimeText
- Remove the Windows 10 Bloatware

## Why ?

I was getting tired of all the complicated steps required to do on a new system to get my tools and scripts to run.
